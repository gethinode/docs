        Hinode uses [Bookshop](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop) to
        support so-called content blocks. Content blocks are reusable page
        elements, such as a hero, about panel, or an FAQ. Hinode includes
        several ready-to-use blocks. Click on a card for more details about
        a content block, including its frontmatter configuration.
