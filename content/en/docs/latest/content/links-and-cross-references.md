## Internal links

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since release {{< release version="v0.26.0" short="true" type="link" >}}, Hinode renders all links using a render hook. The support for markdown links requires that any named links use the `{{%/* myshortcode */%}}` notation instead of `{{</* myshortcode */>}}` notation going forward.

Hugo provides the shortcode `ref` to link to another page within the site. The shortcode returns an absolute path. You can provide the document path as input. If you omit the leading `/`, the page is first resolved relative to the current page, then to the remainder of the site. Review {{< link hugo_links >}}Hugo's documentation{{< /link >}} for more examples and advanced options.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD037 -->
{{< example lang="hugo" >}}
[Tables]({{%/* ref "tables" */%}})

[About]({{%/* ref "credits" */%}})
{{< /example >}}
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD037 -->

Similar to the `ref` shortcode, Hugo provides the shortcode `relref` to return a path relative to the current page.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD037 -->
{{< example lang="hugo" >}}
[Tables]({{%/* relref "tables" */%}})

[About]({{%/* relref "credits" */%}})
{{< /example >}}
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD037 -->

## Cross-references

When using Markdown document types, Hugo generates element IDs for every heading on a page. Spaces are replaced with `-`. For example:

```markdown
## An example reference
```

produces the following HTML:

```html
<h2 id="an-example-reference">An example reference</h2>
```

You can add a cross-reference to the section heading by specifying the generated ID as input for the `ref` and `relref` shortcodes, preceded by a `#`.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD037 -->
{{< example lang="hugo" >}}
[Reference]({{%/* ref "#reference" */%}})

[Reference]({{%/* relref "#reference" */%}})
{{< /example >}}
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD037 -->

## External links

Hugo supports basic Markdown to create links to external websites. The following sections explain the various options.

### Basic links

Hugo supports basic Markdown to create links to external websites. To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., `[Duck Duck Go]`) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., `(https://duckduckgo.com)`).

{{< example lang="markdown" >}}
My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).
{{< /example >}}

### Asset links

Hinode supports validated links to published assets since release {{< release version="v0.26.3" short="true" type="link" >}}. Store the assets as either {{< link hugo_page_resources >}}page resource{{< /link >}} or in the site's `static` folder. Pending on the media type, the browser will open or download the file.

The following example opens an image stored in the `static` folder (photo by {{< link "https://unsplash.com/@christiane_simone_coaching" >}}Christiane S Hartl{{< /link >}} on {{< link "https://unsplash.com/photos/green-frog-on-black-leather-textile-gsqpUyM0DPI" >}}Unsplash{{< /link >}}) in the current window.

{{< example lang="markdown" >}}
[View example image](/img/sample-frog.jpg)
{{< /example>}}

### URLs and email addresses

To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.

{{< example lang="markdown" >}}
<https://www.markdownguide.org>

<fake@example.com>
{{< /example >}}

### Reference-style links

Instead of using parentheses, you can use brackets to link to a predefined address. The following example uses a named reference to link to the website of Font Awesome.

{{< example lang="markdown" >}}
[Font Awesome][fontawesome]

[fontawesome]: https://fontawesome.com
{{< /example >}}

### Managed links

Hinode uses `config/_default/params.toml` to manage links to external addresses in a single place. You can [use the link shortcode to generate a managed link]({{% relref "link" %}}). The following snippet of `config/_default/params.toml` defines the link address for `fontawesome`:

```toml
[links]
    fontawesome = "https://fontawesome.com"
```

You can then use the following statement to generate the link.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD037 -->
{{< example lang="markdown" >}}
{{</* link fontawesome /*/>}}
{{< /example >}}
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD037 -->

You can [configure the behavior of managed links]({{% relref "layout#extended-configuration" %}}) in the `/config/_default/params.toml` file in the `main.externalLinks` section.

## Shortcode links

You can also use the {{< link "/docs/components/link/" />}} shortcode as convenience.
