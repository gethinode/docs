Hinode uses a structured approach to {{< link hugo_structure >}}organize and present content{{< /link >}}. This results in user-friendly URLs, which are also easy to crawl by search engines. The following paragraphs describe how to organize the content and how to define alternative paths.

## Organization of content

Hinode recognizes three basic types of pages:

- **List pages** provide an overview of single pages within the same section
- **Single pages** define a specific page that get published to a specific permalink
- **Content snippets** provide input for a specific page, but do not have a permalink of their own

All content resides in the `content` folder of the repository. The content for [multilanguage sites]({{% relref "languages" %}}) uses separate subfolders for each language directly below the `content` folder. Usually a list page is defined by having an `_index.md` within its folder. A notable exception is the home page, which is defined in the `content` root folder. The next diagram illustrates a typical initial setup for a Hinode website that supports the English language.

```text
.
└── content
    └── en                        // <- [Language]
        └── _index.md             // <- [Home page]   https://example.com/en
        └── about.md              // <- [Single page] https://example.com/en/about
        └── blog
        |   ├── _index.md         // <- [List page]   https://example.com/en/posts/
        |   └── first-post.md     // <- [Single page] https://example.com/en/posts/first-post/
        └── features
        |   ├── index.md          // <- [bundle]      not published separately
        |   └── my-feature.md     // <- [snippet]     not published separately
        └── projects
            ├── _index.md         // <- [List page]   https://example.com/en/projects/
            └── first-project.md  // <- [Single page] https://example.com/en/projects/first-project/
```

## Defining alternative paths

You can adjust the path or provide an alias of a page in its [frontmatter]({{% relref "layout#default-layout" %}}). For example, the following aliases ensure the [introduction ]({{% relref "introduction" %}}) of the Hinode docs is available on four alternative paths:

```yml
---
title: Introduction
aliases:
  - "/docs/0.9/getting-started/"
  - "/docs/getting-started/"
  - "/getting-started/"
  - "/docs/"
layout: docs
---
```

Similarly, you can link multiple translations of a page and still provide a language-specific path. See the [languages configuration]({{% relref "languages#content-translation" %}}) for more details.

## Configuring content snippets

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Content snippets will no longer be supported in future Hinode releases. Instead, content editors are encouraged to use content blocks instead. Content blocks are a new feature that is still in [beta](https://github.com/gethinode/hinode/issues/1430#issuecomment-2988697852). The implementation is subject to change. The documentation on this website is still being worked on.

{{< release version="v0.12.0" >}}

Hinode supports content snippets that are not published anywhere, unlike list pages and single pages. These snippets can be referenced by regular pages instead. A typical example would be an overview of product features. The features themselves can be listed on the homepage, but do not have a permalink of their own. Content snippets can be [listed like a regular section]({{% relref "layout#page-sections" %}}).

Add a file `index.md` to the root of your section that contains your code snippets (please observe the absence of the '_' prefix). Set the parameter `headless` to `true` in file's frontmatter to {{< link hugo_headless >}}make the section headless{{< /link >}}:

```yml
---
headless: true
---
```
