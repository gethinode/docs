Hinode is fully open source and welcomes any contribution, either big or small. To streamline the contribution process, please take a moment to review the guidelines outlined in this article.

## Using the issue tracker

The {{< link issue_tracker >}}issue tracker{{< /link >}} on GitHub is the preferred channel for bug reports, feature requests and submitting pull requests.

## Asking for support

Use the {{< link discussions >}}GitHub Discussions{{< /link >}} to ask for {{< link discussions_help >}}support from the Hinode community{{< /link >}}. The discussion forum also includes other topics, such as {{< link discussions_ideas >}}ideas{{< /link >}} and {{< link discussions_showcases >}}showcases{{< /link >}}. We strive for a safe, welcoming, and productive community. The {{< link community_guidelines >}}community guidelines{{< /link >}} provide more context about the expectations, moderation policy, and terms of service.

## Bug reports

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code in the repository. This may also include issues with the documentation or configuration files. Before filing a bug report, please consider the following guidelines:

- Validate your HTML and Markdown content to ensure your problem isn't caused by a simple error in your own code.
- Use the GitHub {{< link issue_tracker >}}issue search{{< /link >}} — check if the issue has already been reported.
- Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest main in the {{< link repository >}}repository{{< /link >}}.
- Isolate the problem — ideally create a reduced test case.
- Use the provided template in the {{< link issue_tracker >}}issue tracker{{< /link >}} to capture the context, evidence and steps on how to reproduce the issue.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. Please use the provided template in the {{< link issue_tracker >}}issue tracker{{< /link >}} to capture the idea and context.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any **significant** pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project. For trivial things, or things that don't require a lot of your time, you can go ahead and make a PR.

Please adhere to the [coding guidelines](#coding-guidelines) used throughout the project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work included in the project:

1. Fork the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/hinode.git
    cd hinode
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/gethinode/hinode
    ```

1. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main
    ```

1. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
    ```

1. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these {{< link commit_message >}}git commit message guidelines{{</link >}}. Use Git's {{< link github_rebase >}}interactive rebase{{< /link >}} feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

1. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

    ```bash
    git pull [--rebase] upstream main
    ```

1. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin <topic-branch-name>
    ```

1. Open a {{< link github_pr >}}Pull Request{{< /link >}} with a clear title and description against the main branch.
