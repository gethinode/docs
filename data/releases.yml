# - title: Hugo modules
#   icon: fas puzzle-piece
#   color: warning
#   date: 2023-07-19
#   badge: v0.16.0
#   url: v0.16.0
#   content:
#     This release of Hinode introduces support for Hugo modules to create a flexible build system. By configuring a
#     module as either core or optional, you have full control of how these modules are processed and integrated with
#     your Hinode site. npm is still supported, but is no longer a prerequisite.

- title: Versioned documentation
  icon: fas book-open
  color: primary
  date: 2023-06-26
  badge: v0.15.0
  url: v0.15.0
  content:
    This release of Hinode introduces support for versioned documentation. You can either maintain the different
    versions within the same repository, or use an approach with multi-branch deployments (currently supported for
    Netlify).

- title: Menu aliases
  icon: fas bars
  color: info
  date: 2023-05-17
  badge: v0.14.0
  url: v0.14.0
  content:
    This release improves the visualization of active items in the main navigation. By default, Hinode marks a main menu
    item as active by matching its permalink with the address of the current page. This release introduces a
    configurable option to override this selection. By adding a parameter called alias, you can now explicitly instruct
    the navigation to select a specific menu item.

- title: Code refactoring
  icon: fas code
  color: warning
  date: 2023-05-15
  badge: v0.13.0
  url: v0.13.0
  content:
    This release of Hinode is a stability update that refactors the code for sections, including page snippets.

- title: Content snippets
  icon: fas scissors
  color: primary
  date: 2023-04-25
  badge: v0.12.0
  url: v0.12.0
  content:
    This release overhauls the configuration of sections. Hinode now adds supports for so-called content snippets.
    These snippets are not published as permalinks, but can be included on other pages. A typical example would be a
    list of product features that are listed on the homepage. The configuration of the page sections has been adjusted
    to support both regular pages and content snippets. The configuration itself has also been improved.

- title: Sidebar nesting
  icon: fas bars-staggered
  color: info
  date: 2023-04-05
  badge: v0.11.0
  url: v0.11.0
  content:
    This release introduces support for nesting of menus in the sidebar navigation. Previously, nesting was supported
    at two levels deep. With this release, the level of nesting is no longer limited. This should be especially helpful
    for larger documentation sites.

- title: CSS purging
  icon: fas broom
  color: warning
  date: 2023-04-03
  badge: v0.10.0
  url: v0.10.0
  content:
    This release introduces support to purge unused CSS. Both Bootstrap and Font Awesome introduce many CSS definitions
    that may not be needed to render the final site. Removing these unnecessary settings reduces the file size of the
    stylesheet, thus optimizing the speed of the page load. The setting is disabled by default, as it requires thorough
    testing and tweaking. A user guide is available on how to use this setting to optimize the user experience.

- title: Color modes
  icon: fas circle-half-stroke
  color: primary
  date: 2023-02-17
  badge: v0.9.0
  url: v0.9.0
  content:
    This release introduces the much anticipated native support for color modes by Bootstrap. This enables live
    switching between light themes and dark themes, or support for custom color modes. This release introduces several
    hot fixes, as the Bootstrap release is still in alpha. These hot fixes will be removed once Bootstrap reaches its
    stable release.

- title: Release of gethinode.com
  icon: fas globe
  color: info
  date: 2023-02-04
  badge: v0.8.0
  url: v0.8.0
  content:
    Hinode originated as a personal project. The main repository included many documentation pages, which are not
    relevant for a starter template. This release launches a new website on https://gethinode.com. The ownership of the
    repositories is transferred to a new organization. The documentation pages are now separated from the main
    repository to provide a clean starting point for derived repositories.

- title: Image carousel
  icon: fas images
  color: warning
  date: 2022-12-05
  badge: v0.7.1
  url: v0.7.1
  content:
    This release introduces support for the carousel element. The carousel is a slideshow component for cycling through
    images. It uses the image shortcode to ensure the images are responsive.

- title: Internationalization
  icon: fas flag
  color: primary
  date: 2022-12-03
  badge: v0.6.0
  url: v0.6.0
  content:
    This release introduces support for multilingual sites and internationalization. A new dropdown item in the main
    navigation simplifies switching between available languages. By taking advantage of Hugo's content organization,
    switching between page translations should be seamless.

- title: Command prompt
  icon: fas terminal
  color: info
  date: 2022-10-28
  badge: v0.5.0
  url: v0.5.0
  content:
    Inspired by the Command Line plugin for Prism, this release introduces a shortcode to embed a command prompt within
    Markdown content. The command prompt supports Bash, PowerShell, and SQL. You can adjust the host, user, and prompt
    itself. The shortcode also supports line continuation and outputs.

- title: Spacing optimization
  icon: fas border-none
  color: warning
  date: 2022-04-18
  badge: v0.4
  url: v0.4
  content:
    This release enhances the spacing of the navbar and main page elements.

- title: Syntax highlighting
  icon: fas highlighter
  color: primary
  date: 2022-04-16
  badge: v0.3
  url: v0.3
  content:
    This release introduces support for native syntax highlighting of code blocks. A button is added at run-time to
    enable copying of the code to the clipboard.

- title: Template
  icon: fas copy
  color: info
  date: 2022-04-14
  badge: v0.2
  url: v0.2
  content:
    Inspired by Doks, this release introduces a child theme of Hinode. The child theme uses npm to refer to the latest
    available package. npm brings the benefit that dependencies can be automatically upgraded as part of the CI/CD
    process. It also abstracts from the core code of Hinode, keeping child repositories small and focused.

- title: Initial launch
  icon: fas rocket
  color: warning
  date: 2022-04-13
  badge: v0.1
  url: v0.1
  content:
    Inspired by Blist and Doks, this release introduces Hinode - a modern blog and documentation theme for Hugo. By
    taking advantage of npm, the used dependencies are easily tracked and updated. Powered by Bootstrap, the generated
    website is responsive and brings many common UI elements. Hinode wraps many of these elements in a shortcode to
    simplify their usage.
