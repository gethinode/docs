    This release simplifies the {{< link "docs/configuration/cookie-consent/" >}}integration with cookie consent managers
    {{< /link >}}. A reference implementation for {{< link hinode_mod_cookieyes >}}CookieYes{{< /link >}} is available
    as a separate module. This release also improves the management of content security policies. You can now define the
    required policies in each individual module, and Hinode will {{< link "docs/advanced-settings/server-headers/" >}}
    generate the required server headers{{< /link >}}.

- title: Render hooks
  icon: fa file-lines
  color: info
  date: 2024-08-15
  badge: v0.26.0
  url: v0.26.0
  content:
    This release includes support for markdown links and markdown images. Hinode will invoke the relevant partials, so
    they will have the same behavior and styling as their counterparts. This release also includes support for
    server-side math rendering as introduced by [Hugo v0.132.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.132.0).

  color: warning
  date: 2024-08-02
  badge: v0.25.0
  url: v0.25.0
  content:
    Hinode includes search support out of the box. To limit the bundle size, the search index now includes entries for
    the current translation only. To enable localization, the module configuration includes a new parameter `localize`.
    By default, the FlexSearch module sets localization to true. See the
    {{< link "docs/configuration/modules#configuring-modules" >}} module configuration{{< /link >}} for all available
    options.

- title: Digital Asset Managers
  icon: fa image
  color: primary
  date: 2024-06-03
  badge: v0.24.0
  url: v0.24.0
  content:
    Hinodes uses Hugoâ€™s image processing to preprocess images on the server side. Hugo uses caching to reduce the build
    time. Despite the caching techniques, the image processing can take significant time, especially on larger sites. 
    An alternative approach is to use a dedicated Digital Asset Manager. Most managers offer an API to transform images
    on the fly. This release introduces support for several {{< link "docs/configuration/digital-asset-managers" />}},
    including Cloudinary, ImageKit.io, and Imgix. The required adapters are configurable.

- title: Maintenance
  icon: fas screwdriver-wrench
  color: info
  date: 2024-03-17
  badge: v0.23.0
  url: v0.23.0
  content:
    This release is mostly a maintenance release that refactors several assets. It introduces several changes to ensure
    Hinode is fully compatible with Hugo `v0.123.x` and `v0.124.0`. With Hugo's recent improvements, you can expect a
    reduction of build times. Behind the scenes, this release introduces several changes to prepare for an upcoming
    overhaul of the page rendering. Using so-called content blocks, a future release of Hinode will support composable
    page elements such as a hero section, about section, and more. A sneak preview is available on
    https://theme-agency.gethinode.com/en/.

- title: Argument validation
  icon: fas sliders
  color: warning
  date: 2024-01-04
  badge: v0.22.0
  url: v0.22.0
  content:
    Hinode supports more than 30 shortcodes. Most of these shortcodes support multiple arguments to configure their
    behavior and to adjust their visual appearance. A new utility uses a data file to validate the available arguments,
    their types, and supported values for each shortcode and underlying partial. A new shortcode
    {{< link "docs/components/args" >}}args{{< /link >}} uses the same specification to generate shortcode
    documentation. Visit the page about {{< link "docs/advanced-settings/partial-development/" />}} to familiarize
    yourself with the new conventions.

- title: Taxonomies
  icon: fas list
  color: primary
  date: 2023-11-05
  badge: v0.21.0
  url: v0.21.0
  content:
    This release introduces support to include taxonomies as regular content sections. You can filter the taxonomies by
    keywords to make them more specific. In addition, Hinode now supports content view templates to simplify the
    implementation of new layout types. Finally, the handling of images and scripts has been improved to further reduce
    the loading time of the site.

- title: Dart Sass
  icon: fab sass
  color: info
  date: 2023-09-07
  badge: v0.20.0
  url: v0.20.0
  content:
    The extended version of Hugo includes LibSass to transpile Sass to CSS. In 2020, the Sass team
    {{< link hugo_sass >}}deprecated LibSass in favor of Dart Sass{{< /link >}}. Hinode now supports this new library so
    you can use the latest features of the Sass language. Visit the {{< link "docs/advanced-settings/styles" >}}styles
    settings on how to enable Dart Sass {{< /link >}}. The stylesheet now also takes advantage of caching, so you can
    expect a reduction of ~25% build time.

- title: Markdown by default
  icon: fab markdown
  color: warning
  date: 2023-09-02
  badge: v0.19.0
  url: v0.19.0
  content:
    This release ensures Hinode is Markdown-only by default. Although still supported, HTML is now opt-in instead of
    opt-out to improve security and to simplify content management. Several new shortcodes, such as
    {{< link "docs/components/abbr" >}}abbr{{< /link >}} and {{< link "docs/components/badge" >}}badge{{< /link >}}, are
    introduced to replace previous HTML elements.

    Two new helpers are available to improve the
    [contrast of the primary color in dark mode]({{% relref "color-modes#accessibility" %}}). In addition, several
    accessibility improvements have been made under the hood. Finally, with the help of
    {{< link github_aefly >}}@aefly{{< /link>}}, {{< link hinode_fr >}}Hinode is now available in the French language
    {{< /link >}} as well.

- title: Inline icons

  color: info
  date: 2023-08-02
  badge: v0.17.0
  url: v0.17.0
  content:
    Up until now, Hinode used web fonts and stylesheets to display Font Awesome icons. This release adds support for
    inline icons using vector images. These vector icons still support the common styling and animation directives. When
    enabled, the size of the generated site's assets should be ~200k less on average.

- title: Hugo modules
  icon: fas puzzle-piece
  color: warning
  date: 2023-07-21
  badge: v0.16.0
  url: v0.16.0

  badge: v0.15.0
  url: v0.15.0

    versions within the same repository, or use an approach with multi-branch deployments (currently supported for
    Netlify).

- title: Menu aliases
  icon: fas bars
  color: info
  date: 2023-05-17
  badge: v0.14.0
  url: v0.14.0
  content:
    This release improves the visualization of active items in the main navigation. By default, Hinode marks a main menu
    item as active by matching its permalink with the address of the current page. This release introduces a
    configurable option to override this selection. By adding a parameter called alias, you can now explicitly instruct
    the navigation to select a specific menu item.

- title: Code refactoring
  icon: fas code
  color: warning
  date: 2023-05-15
  badge: v0.13.0

- title: Content snippets
  icon: fas scissors
  color: primary
  date: 2023-04-25
  badge: v0.12.0
  url: v0.12.0
  content:
    This release overhauls the configuration of sections. Hinode now adds supports for so-called content snippets.
    These snippets are not published as permalinks, but can be included on other pages. A typical example would be a
    list of product features that are listed on the homepage. The configuration of the page sections has been adjusted
    to support both regular pages and content snippets. The configuration itself has also been improved.

- title: Sidebar nesting
  icon: fas bars-staggered
  color: info
  date: 2023-04-05
  badge: v0.11.0
  url: v0.11.0
  content:

    at two levels deep. With this release, the level of nesting is no longer limited. This should be especially helpful
    for larger documentation sites.

- title: CSS purging
  icon: fas broom
  color: warning
  date: 2023-04-03
  badge: v0.10.0
  url: v0.10.0
  content:
    This release introduces support to purge unused CSS. Both Bootstrap and Font Awesome introduce many CSS definitions
    that may not be needed to render the final site. Removing these unnecessary settings reduces the file size of the
    stylesheet, thus optimizing the speed of the page load. The setting is disabled by default, as it requires thorough
    testing and tweaking. A user guide is available on how to use this setting to optimize the user experience.

- title: Color modes
  icon: fas circle-half-stroke
  color: primary
  date: 2023-02-17
  badge: v0.9.0
  url: v0.9.0

    This release introduces the much anticipated native support for color modes by Bootstrap. This enables live
    switching between light themes and dark themes, or support for custom color modes. This release introduces several
    hot fixes, as the Bootstrap release is still in alpha. These hot fixes will be removed once Bootstrap reaches its
    stable release.

  badge: v0.8.0
  url: v0.8.0
  content:
    Hinode originated as a personal project. The main repository included many documentation pages, which are not
    relevant for a starter template. This release launches a new website on https://gethinode.com. The ownership of the
    repositories is transferred to a new organization. The documentation pages are now separated from the main
    repository to provide a clean starting point for derived repositories.

- title: Image carousel
  icon: fas images
  color: warning
  date: 2022-12-05
  badge: v0.7.1
  url: v0.7.1

  color: primary
  date: 2022-12-03
  badge: v0.6.0
  url: v0.6.0
  content:

  date: 2022-10-28
  badge: v0.5.0
  url: v0.5.0
  content:

    enable copying of the code to the clipboard.

- title: Template
  icon: fas copy
  color: info
  date: 2022-04-14
  badge: v0.2
  url: v0.2
  content:
    Inspired by Doks, this release introduces a child theme of Hinode. The child theme uses npm to refer to the latest
    available package. npm brings the benefit that dependencies can be automatically upgraded as part of the
    {{< abbr "CI/CD" >}} process. It also abstracts from the core code of Hinode, keeping child repositories small and
    focused.

- title: Initial launch
  icon: fas rocket
  color: warning

  badge: v0.1
  url: v0.1
  content:
    Inspired by Blist and Doks, this release introduces Hinode - a modern blog and documentation theme for Hugo. By
    taking advantage of npm, the used dependencies are easily tracked and updated. Powered by Bootstrap, the generated
    website is responsive and brings many common UI elements. Hinode wraps many of these elements in a shortcode to
    simplify their usage.
